# Comparing Web Frameworks Based on Animation Performance

The purpose of this document is to inform anyone on how to setup and run the tests that our group performed for our class project in CPS 691. 

### Group #2 Consisted of:
* Stephane Maillard
* Safayet Mohammad
* Jared Dunham
* Gary Pinsky 

## Preliminary Information 

Our project explores the performance of various web frameworks based on how efficiently they run animations on their webpages. The main goal of this project is to compare the performance of JavaScript-based web frameworks vs Web Assembly (based on animations). To test the animations, we designed three different web pages in each framework that performed different styles of animations. 

For each web frame work, we designed a webpage that did one of the following animations:
* Balls bouncing across the screen
* Squares fading in and out of the visibility on the screen
* A pulse effect with squares

The web frameworks that we compared are: 
* React
* Vue
* Angular
* Web Assembly

The metrics used to compare these websites are:
* Page Load Time
* Memory Utilization
* Framerate

## Setting up your environment to run all websites

To test all websites, you will have to setup your machine to run the four web frameworks and download the required packages for our python script.
